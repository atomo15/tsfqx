# Assignment 11


- I plan to attend the Evolution Working Group.


## Reflections on the podcast:
- Make me understand more about:
  - How CHAOSS form as a team?
  - The Background of CHAOSS?
  - What's the purpose of the CHAOSS?
  - How CHAOSS tools help the developer?
  
All of this information makes me understand more about CHAOSS and how does it work 


Since at first, I had no idea what is the CHAOSS and the purpose of CHAOSS.
